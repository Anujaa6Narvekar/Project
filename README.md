Covid Chat Bot
Problem Statement: On 11 March 2020, the WHO Director-General “rang the alarm bell loud and clear” by calling COVID-19 a pandemic. Globally and locally, control and prevention measures have been frustrated by myriad challenges. First, accurate information is crucial, but often unknown, or obscured by misinformation. During a pandemic, people do not know what to do. Doing too little (e.g., not following prophylactic measures) can increase everyone’s risk of infection.
Pandemics have unique characteristics that make them amenable to tailored interventions deliverable via chatbots. 
This is a Covid Chat Bot which answers Covid related queries.


Project Description: Our Project is intended to help and support people with the necessary information on the global pandemic.
It tackles the crucial threat and despair caused by COVID-19. Chatbots have varied widely in their responses to questions about physical health. Chatbots provide a single answer to most questions, they are able to present concise information from credible sources.
Chatbots, in contrast to newspapers and online information sources, can often hear and respond in natural language, improving access for people who cannot read or have difficulty using the internet.
This project is related to the global pandemic of Covid -19. It has a QnA set related to the covid queries. When a user asks a relevant query regarding Covid-19 it responds with an appropriate answer.
